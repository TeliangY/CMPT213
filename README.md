# Maze Exploration Game

[TOC]



## Description

This is a treasure hunt game where players need to control treasure hunters to 	collect artifacts hidden in the maze. Whenever a treasure hunter reaches a cell 	with a relic, the treasure hunter automatically collects that relic, and another 	relic will appear somewhere in the maze.

Unfortunately for treasure hunters, there are 3 guards in the maze and will kill 	anyone looking for treasure. If the guardian and treasure hunter occupy the 	same square, the guardian kills the treasure hunter and the player loses the 	game (note: there may be multiple guardians in the same square). Luckily the 	Guardians aren't very smart, so they can't track the treasure hunter: they move 	pseudo-randomly and are not affected by the treasure hunter's location.
